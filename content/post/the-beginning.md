Well, I am breaking down and starting to blog.  I make not promises on frequency.  I plan to blog about technologies I am either working with or studying.

I currently work as a Senior Network Engineer consulting across multiple verticals from the education to enterprise.  I manage and deploy firewalls, switches, wireless, and cloud networking so topics could be all over the place.  

If you found this, welcome to the chaos.
